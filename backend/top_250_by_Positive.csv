CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, etc.). 'Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999,' said Doug Lombardi at Valve. 'For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.'","['Czech', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'English', 'Finnish', 'French', 'German', 'Hungarian', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Swedish', 'Thai', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Bulgarian', 'Ukrainian', 'Greek', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Vietnamese']","['English', 'Vietnamese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/header.jpg?t=1641233427,http://blog.counter-strike.net/,,,True,True,True,83,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,5764420,766677,,167,3441592,Includes intense violence and blood.,30484,777,6357,253,"Valve,Hidden Path Entertainment",Valve,"Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,In-App Purchases,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled,Stats,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV","Action,Free to Play","FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,Competitive,Action,Team-Based,e-sports,Tactical,First-Person,PvP,Online Co-Op,Co-op,Strategy,Military,War,Difficult,Trading,Realistic,Fast-Paced,Moddable","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_118cb022b9a43f70d2e5a2df7427f29088b6b191.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_d196d945c6170e9cadaf67a6dea675bd5fa7a046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_8c9cce9a9dde7b9c020837dcbd4615efe6f77d66.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_2b9e362287b509bb3864fa7bad654fe1fda0f7ed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_855c016cde14b7cec5c3d2523589b9054c030010.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_34090867f1a02b6c17652ba9043e3f622ed985a9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_77215ea1b454c08a75351a74585a5b089142da3e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_110be563b66dde31b3b00dcf7d2f644c50374f07.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_92c05c1cb1319beb15ed92c63b6b1d6f261d2f64.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_3cef516c1a3c338f2554f3f11790aba3b7c0add7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/ss_60b4f959497899515f46012df805b0006ef21af6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641233427","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/81958/movie_max.mp4?t=1554409259,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028283/movie_max.mp4?t=1554409264,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028284/movie_max.mp4?t=1554409270,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028286/movie_max.mp4?t=1554409276,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028287/movie_max.mp4?t=1554409281,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028288/movie_max.mp4?t=1554409287,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028289/movie_max.mp4?t=1554409293,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028285/movie_max.mp4?t=1554409299"

You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means. Beyond the Sandbox The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide &amp; Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties. We have one of the most vibrant Steam Community Workshops, with over 300'000 models, maps, and contraptions to download. It has everything from new tools to improve your builds, to guns that fire rainbow-tinged nuclear blasts from space. Take as much or as little as you need: its all free.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"Aug 13, 2013",20000000,45663,18,9.99,75,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid  Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET  The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level  Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios  No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills  As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever  PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications  A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way  Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content  More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.","['English', 'German',

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Jun 14, 2016",10000000,46073,17,7.99,34,"Death Is Not an Escape. Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at Key Features  Survive Together Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?  Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so youll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.  A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killers unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.

346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,"Aug 27, 2017",10000000,98215,0,29.99,15,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well youve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARKs god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, youll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example.

304930,Unturned,"Jul 7, 2017",20000000,54184,0,0.0,1,"STAY UNTURNED You're one of the few not yet turned zombie. Keeping it that way will be a challenge. Go in guns blazing and attract the attention of everything, living and dead. Take a subtle approach sneaking around and making use of distractions. Confront and learn to counter special abilities ranging from invisibility to fire breathing to lightning attacks. STRUGGLE AGAINST NATURE Zombies aside nature does plenty to make life hard. Forage wild fruits and vegetables. Hunt animals for pelts and meat, or in some hostile environments become the prey. Fish for food and garbage. Plant a crop and make sure it gets rain. Seek warmth and take shelter from blizzards. DEAL WITH OTHER PLAYERS Friend or foe there's a lot of interesting people online. Arrest bandits with handcuffs and blindfold them as a non-lethal strategy. Fight with every kind of weapon under the sun - swords, machine guns, snipers, missiles, landmines - you name it. Raid enemy encampments using charges and detonators and steal their loot. For pure PvP play arena mode in a last man standing battle to the death, or PvE for peaceful cooperation. Roleplay servers encourage everyone to stay in character and tell a story together. HELP THE NEW SOCIETY Plenty to do even if you're offline or going solo. Meet, talk and trade with NPCs. Complete quests to aid NPCs and progress the story. Fend off waves of the undead to clear hordes. Secure airdropped supplies. Gear up with gasmasks to scout radioactive deadzones. FORTIFY YOUR STRONGHOLD Somewhere to kick back and chillax or a hideout to direct your gang, whatever floats your boat (in this case sometimes literally). Build with barricades, furniture, traps, machinery and more. Board up the windows of existing structures to survive the night. Craft an entirely new structure from supplies you collect. Turn your vehicle into a moving fortress by building on it. TRAVEL BY LAND, AIR AND SEA Roll out in style with a fully stocked garage. Land vehicles including tanks, quads and snowmobiles. Air vehicles from helicopters to seaplanes to fighter jets. Sea vehicles such as jetskis and hovercraft. Maintain your vehicles with tires, batteries and fuel. EXPLORE MASSIVE WORLDS With 5 officially developed and 1 curated community created sandbox map there's a wide variety of locations to discover: Prince Edward Island (PEI) The Yukon Washington Russia Hawaii Germany MOD EVERYTHING From the ground up Unturned was designed for modding. Download player created content ranging from guns to vehicles to huge levels from the workshop, and upload your own. Build custom maps using the in-game level editor. All of the official maps were created with the same free public tools and their assets are open for you to use. Write plugins using built-in or strong third party systems.

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"Aug 9, 2018",10000000,24736,0,29.99,200,"Welcome to a new world! Take on the role of a hunter and slay ferocious monsters in a living, breathing ecosystem where you can use the landscape and its diverse inhabitants to get the upper hand. Hunt alone or in co-op with up to three other players, and use materials collected from fallen foes to craft new gear and take on even bigger, badder beasts! INTRODUCTION Overview Battle gigantic monsters in epic locales. As a hunter, you'll take on quests to hunt monsters in a variety of habitats. Take down these monsters and receive materials that you can use to create stronger weapons and armor in order to hunt even more dangerous monsters. In Monster Hunter: World, the latest installment in the series, you can enjoy the ultimate hunting experience, using everything at your disposal to hunt monsters in a new world teeming with surprises and excitement. Setting Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing. To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined. ECOSYSTEM A World That Breathes Life There are various locations teeming with wildlife. Expeditions into these locales are bound to turn up interesting discoveries. HUNTING A Diverse Arsenal, and an Indispensable Partner Your equipment will give you the power to need to carve out a place for yourself in the New World. The Hunter's Arsenal There are fourteen different weapons at the hunter's disposal, each with its own unique characteristics and attacks. Many hunters acquire proficiency in multiple types, while others prefer to attain mastery of one. Scoutflies Monster tracks, such as footprints and gashes, dot each locale. Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information. Slinger The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale. From diversion tactics to creating shortcuts, the Slinger has a variety of uses, and allows you to hunt in new and interesting ways. Specialized Tools Specialized tools activate powerful effects for a limited amount of time, and up to two can be equipped at a time. Simple to use, they can be selected and activated just like any other item you take out on a hunt. Palicoes Palicoes are hunters' reliable comrades out in the field, specialized in a variety of offensive, defensive, and restorative support abilities. The hunter's Palico joins the Fifth Fleet with pride, as much a bona fide member of the Commission as any other hunter.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Arabic', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Polish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese']",This beautifully implemented port is a perfect PC introduction to the joys of Monster Hunter 95/100  IGN Monster Hunter: Worlds thrilling fights with fantastic beasts never get old 86/100  PC Gamer This is absolutely a buy AngryCentaurGaming (video review),https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/header.jpg?t=1644281885,http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/,http://www.capcom.com/mhwsupport/,,True,False,False,88,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/monster-hunter-world?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,306872,51885,,100,220315,,10717,543,3278,238,"CAPCOM Co., Ltd.","CAPCOM Co., Ltd.","Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on Tablet",Action,"Co-op,Multiplayer,Action,Open World,RPG,Third Person,Character Customization,Adventure,Fantasy,Singleplayer,Difficult,Action RPG,Exploration,Great Soundtrack,Replay Value,Atmospheric,Hack and Slash,JRPG,Souls-like,MMORPG","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/ss_a262c53b8629de7c6547933dc0b49d31f4e1b1f1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644281885,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/ss_6b4986a37c7b5c185a796085c002febcdd5357b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644281885,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/ss_0dfb20f6f09c196bfc317bd517dc430ed6e6a2a4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644281885,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/ss_25902a9ae6977d6d10ebff20b87e8739e51c5b8b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644281885,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/ss_681cc5358ec55a997aee9f757ffe8b418dc79a32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644281885,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/ss_ce69dc57e6e442c73d874f1b701f2e4af405fb19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644281885,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/ss_6d26868b45c20bf4dd5f75f31264aca08ce17217.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644281885,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/ss_669f9008f708c19fe3c41d647516f7a73bf26d24.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644281885","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256769024/movie_max.mp4?t=1578591085,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256769016/movie_max.mp4?t=1578591094,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256765447/movie_max.mp4?t=1578591271,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256747421/movie_max.mp4?t=1578591395,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256746431/movie_max.mp4?t=1578591504,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256737507/movie_max.mp4?t=1578591604,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256721439/movie_max.mp4?t=1578591641"

Play as one of four new vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living planet. Key Features: All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if thats your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other! World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.) 87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot! Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, youll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn! Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.

Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. Youll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more. Loot Up Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Dont forget that you wont get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask. Take your Shot Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid youll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back. Install Mods Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like-minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste. Browse thousands of fan-made features, maps, and guns  all of which are easily managed directly from the game launcher.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Czech', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/header.jpg?t=1658234476,https://www.dayz.com,https://forums.dayz.com/,support@bohemia.net,True,False,False,0,,0,221274,89537,,13,259417,,9087,925,2363,362,Bohemia Interactive,Bohemia Interactive,"Multi-player,MMO,PvP,Online PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","Action,Adventure,Massively Multiplayer","Survival,Zombies,Multiplayer,Open World,Action,PvP,Shooter,Massively Multiplayer,Horror,Post-apocalyptic,Simulation,FPS,Early Access,First-Person,Survival Horror,Sandbox,Adventure,Co-op,Atmospheric,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_7f488d8e49682a8d1643a795fc9047cbbd2dcc9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_0de6d2e7f3b5348d69bb09d60624c78e13f0c8d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_84b557abccd29273cf9313980b4c9f63a12dabdf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_2c77af2ce801e986c77f2af2f0918ad3e47b17df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_7892d0526421d31a3d1eebb6cf919118fcfb2ca5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_38bc8749f418717a6419a5eaec19cf26a7faae27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_de716ef45826665559b5fef34391d5ef0e00452a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_ddf128da4de70b752436b69642a64a4caacafe56.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_447d71a5e1fcf99330d490625301a608f1b2bc48.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_9b90a46d88d1ed9320f00a7bc1aa26c3e0581944.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_33c1b36c2e1eaabab48e4675cde5c7a962d4d785.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/ss_430bbdb8fa1d226d9522f02d031002427cf1b444.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658234476","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256790906/movie_max.mp4?t=1593118262,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256754405/movie_max.mp4?t=1577825105,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256734797/movie_max.mp4?t=1577825130"

264710,Subnautica,"Jan 23, 2018",2000000,3642,0,29.99,1,"Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet. A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you! Dive Into a Vast Underwater World You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. Scavenge, Craft, and Survive After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Construct Underwater Habitats Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean. Unravel the Mystery What happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive? Disrupt the Food Chain The ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators. Handle the Pressure Build a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more. Fear the Night As the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see. Dive Below the Ocean Floor Cave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.

255710,Cities: Skylines,"Mar 10, 2015",5000000,21775,0,29.99,38,"Cities: Skylines is a modern take on the classic city simulation. The game introduces new game play elements to realize the thrill and hardships of creating and maintaining a real city whilst expanding on some well-established tropes of the city building experience. Youre only limited by your imagination, so take control and reach for the sky! Multi-tiered and challenging simulation Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor of your city youll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, fire fighting, healthcare and much more along with your citys real economy system. Citizens within your city react fluidly, with gravitas and with an air of authenticity to a multitude of game play scenarios. Extensive local traffic simulation Colossal Order's extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is fully utilized in a fully fleshed out and well-crafted local traffic simulation. Districts and Policies Be more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city. Utilize the Day and Night Cycle The city changes during the hours of the day and affects citizen schedules. Traffic is visibly slower at night and some zoned areas do not work with full efficiency. Cities: Skylines will put you in control of managing the different aspects of the day and night cycles. Extensive modding support Build or improve on existing maps and structures.

You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire. Join forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer , create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks between you and your friends. Add mods to increase your enjoyment, from small tweak and helper mods to complete game overhauls, Factorio's ground-up Modding support has allowed content creators from around the world to design interesting and innovative features. While the core gameplay is in the form of the freeplay scenario, there are a range of interesting challenges in the form of Scenarios . If you don't find any maps or scenarios you enjoy, you can create your own with the in-game Map Editor , place down entities, enemies, and terrain in any way you like, and even add your own custom script to make for interesting gameplay.

220,Half-Life 2,"Nov 16, 2004",10000000,1015,0,9.99,1,"1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named Best PC Game Ever by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide. NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in: Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial muscles, human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy. Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story&reg; and Monster's, Inc.&reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game. AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Dutch', 'Danish', 'Finnish', 'Japanese', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Swedish', 'Thai']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Thai']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/header.jpg?t=1591063154,http://www.half-life2.com,http://steamcommunity.com/app/220,,True,True,True,96,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/half-life-2?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,142368,3687,,33,110892,,606,185,311,315,Valve,Valve,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Captions available,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Includes Source SDK,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play Together",Action,"FPS,Action,Sci-fi,Classic,Singleplayer,Story Rich,Shooter,First-Person,Adventure,Dystopian,Atmospheric,Zombies,Silent Protagonist,Physics,Aliens,Great Soundtrack,Horror,Puzzle,Multiplayer,Moddable","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001864.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001865.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001866.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001867.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001869.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001870.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001871.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/0000001872.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591063154","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/904/movie_max.mp4?t=1569623096,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/5724/movie_max.mp4?t=1569623106"

It works by controlling the random events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers  theyre crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. Youll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each persons background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill  but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community . Read more at .

700330,SCP: Secret Laboratory,"Dec 29, 2017",5000000,4118,0,0.0,0,"Amidst the chaos of a disastrous mass containment failure at the supposed master site Site-02, you fight your way to the top alongside  and against  other players. From devious D-Class and cunning scientists to elite Mobile Task Force units (MTF), rebellious Chaos Insurgency (CI), and even the horrific SCP Entities, there are many key roles to play in this gruesome affair, so... How will you act amidst a containment breach? SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP: SL) is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game heavily based on the SCP Foundation series and its expanded universe of monsters and paranormal phenomena. The primary objective of the SCP Foundation (also the Foundation) is to safeguard the world from any and all entities, objects, or phenomena that are deemed potential threats to humanity, and thus to uphold the normalcy of the modern world. Recently, however, Chaos Insurgency forces have begun acting against the Foundation in pursuit of a future where humanity reigns supreme. The question is: What role will you play? D-Class Personnel  Inmates kept within the bowels of the Foundation sites as lab rats; test subjects at the mercy of the Foundations cruel practices. Escape from your confines and rebel against your imprisoners  by any means necessary. Foundation Scientists  Researchers, engineers, and division specialists; you must ensure your own survival until an MTF extracts you from the ensuing pandemonium. Use your wit  and access cards  to survive. But be wary of the Class-D scurrying beneath you; theyll do anything to escape their confines. Nine-Tailed Fox Units  The first MTF units to respond to the emergency. Your mission: To extract valuable Foundation personnel and to, with the utmost vehemence, terminate or re-contain any SCPs that have escaped. Foundation Security  On-site security personnel charged with restoring order amidst the chaos. Evacuate Scientists, terminate D-Class Personnel, re-contain escaped SCPs, and above all do whatever it takes to restore normalcy to your site. Chaos Insurgency  Once a mere splinter cell force and now a formidable military power, yet still but a shadow of their former Foundation employers. Your primary objective is to purge the facility of Foundation personnel and seize the assets that are deemed to serve the best interests of Delta Command, your elusive overseers. SCP Entities  Typically hostile sentient beings of an anomalous nature, all of which are extremely different from one another. You are to consider yourself an enemy of all humans, and formidable ones at that. Do not accept any attempts to compromise  you are naught but death. With each match comes new experiences, thrills, and threats. You will battle for survival with every faction: SCP Entities rampaging on their path to escape, Chaos Insurgency sabotaging the Foundation, MTF and Security mobilizing to secure the facility, and armed Scientists and D-Class who refuse to take no for an answer. Be prepared for anything. Rest assured, you will encounter many threats. Friends and foes alike will take up arms against you  you may be disintegrated by a tesla gate, or perhaps a hydrogen bomb lying right beneath your feet will begin its countdown to detonation. There are many ways to die, yet in turn, many ways to survive such a hell. SCP: SL features a growing roster of SCPs that includes the following: Playable SCPs SCP-049  An archaic plague doctor with the sole intent of curing those ridden with the pestilence. Contact means death, but only momentarily; you may find that one of the side effects of the good doctors surgery is being denied such an easy end. SCP-079  A sentient A.I. that has access to most of the facility's hardware and monitoring systems. With the facility under its control, beware the doors you lock tight for safety becoming the reason for your demise. And always remember: You never know who could be watching. SCP-096  An extremely slender, frail-looking humanoid. It hides its face for a reason. Simply peering at it will induce a state of unstoppable rage, in which it massacres anything around with its immense strength. Running is futile. Don't even peek. SCP-106  A humanoid composed of an anomalous jet-black substance. Contact means certain death, or supposedly an equivalent of such. Presume youre never safe whilst 106 looms. SCP-173  A mere concrete sculpture, upon first glance. On second glance, youll notice its somehow closer. There is no third glance  you're dead by then. SCP-939  A pack-dependent predator that intelligently mimics human voices to deceive and entrap its desired prey. Remember who your allies are. Be wary of who you trust. Don't fall for stray imitations, lest youre repaid with a bite. Object SCPs SCP-018  A red 1969 Blam-O Super Ball that doubles its velocity with each rebound. Only aim towards targets authorized for immediate termination. SCP-207  A bottle of cola, the contents of which offer radically increased motor functioning, for the mere cost of a completely devastated metabolism. You must ask yourself the question: Is momentary salvation worth the torturous death sure to follow? SCP-268  A tweed newsboy cap that makes the wearer invisible to the naked eye. Don to avoid death or make a daring escape  the possibilities are endless, so long as you dont draw unwanted attention. SCP-330 - A candy bowl filled with various treats and side effects, but the flavours are to die for. Remember to take no more than two! SCP-500  A single red pill capable of instantaneously curing any affliction. Such a wonder drug is irreplaceable  think carefully before use. SCP-914  An anomalous machine that is capable of improving or degrading whatever contents are placed within  all at the whim of its user. SCP-2176 - An anomalous lightbulb containing a Class-A Ectomorph, capable of disrupting electrical systems within the facility  be careful not to drop it! Site-02 is an unforgiving place. Stay on your toes, follow protocol, survive or die for the cause, and remember We die in the dark so others may live in the light.  SCP: SL was initially based on the original single-player horror game SCP  Containment Breach (2012), by Undertow Games. More recently, Northwood Studios deviated from SCP  Containment Breach , creating a unique setting and expanding lore, with an ultimate goal of presenting players with a complete and immersive game experience.","['English', 'Polish', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Czech', 'Dutch', 'Russian', 'French', 'Turkish', 'Portuguese', 'Ukrainian', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean', 'Hungarian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Finnish', 'Danish', 'Japanese', 'Norwegian', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Thai', 'Swedish', 'Vietnamese', 'Romanian']","['English', 'Romanian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/header.jpg?t=1650127138,https://scpslgame.com/,https://support.scpslgame.com/,,True,False,False,0,,0,128828,11947,,35,0,,894,70,68,80,Northwood Studios,Northwood Studios,"Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","Action,Free to Play","Free to Play,Horror,Multiplayer,First-Person,Co-op,Survival Horror,Shooter,Online Co-Op,Action,FPS,Memes,Sci-fi,Survival,Psychological Horror,Atmospheric,Strategy,Difficult,Indie,Adventure,Fantasy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_56ac99b44995d1029cb5af31ac56337664286990.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_9a858e23c41e70f80404fdb3640131b30891cbb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_fe677f119902a29afc265449c4d335ef9b4156bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_f2a2127d26eb3dbc3d82e3de45ce5644182a187f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_600400d9e97291211f212ccf15db1def4acf089e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_aa1279910b2a0d84b2e0c9a4fce18b39b40485d2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_c1d900e2a5debc20d95dbc224c1ab8093429a6aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_03e46947d30b54a531ac23232afb614fd0e7265c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_5eafd755b4450302478edd5c06cb9309a1107596.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_ff4d626ef0ff11cbed228feb5a87e060f562be9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_3b1dbef2b30b05a90fe5bd346ab3f2b1a6c08aa7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_570b0484b650703894a8d6137f30ba6fcdd8d7ce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_a373e4a7ab3ca6ae412b4ef15d2e8a3f5e93f8ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_7197ff9996aaa7100f4fce40ee5867a80a4b9476.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/700330/ss_ad76d326e17742b17edfdabd533eca88f4db0a10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1650127138","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256857058/movie_max.mp4?t=1634926018,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256869230/movie_max.mp4?t=1642184169,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256857069/movie_max.mp4?t=1634926026"

Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or 'tug of war'. Ambush --- A high value target ('HVT') must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Dutch', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Ukrainian']","['English', 'Ukrainian']",This game has me hooked and I see it as a proudly raised middle finger in the face of large developers who seem to completely ignore fairness and player equality in favour of potential income. 9.0  Hooked Gamers Insurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay.

Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way  mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world. This is a game of two halves  one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose  delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign.

Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles.

If you own both parts 1 and 2, youll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex  and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Czech', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Turkish', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Traditional Chinese']","Four fun, distinct factions and a story-driven campaign in Total War: Warhammer 2 set a new bar for the series 9.1  IGN Warhammer 2 is Total War perfected Recommended  Eurogamer A maximalist sequel that improves on almost every aspect of the first game. 92/100  PC Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/header.jpg?t=1644489785,,http://support.sega.co.uk,,True,True,True,87,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/total-war-warhammer-ii?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,107577,8177,,152,80874,,12635,342,3956,290,"CREATIVE ASSEMBLY,Feral Interactive (Mac),Feral Interactive (Linux)","SEGA,Feral Interactive (Mac),Feral Interactive (Linux)","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,LAN PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,LAN Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Remote Play on Tablet","Action,Strategy","Strategy,Fantasy,Turn-Based Strategy,RTS,Grand Strategy,War,Multiplayer,Games Workshop,Action,Turn-Based,Singleplayer,Dark Fantasy,Co-op,Tactical,Real Time Tactics,Story Rich,Atmospheric,Dinosaurs,Great Soundtrack,Warhammer 40K","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_25005f9028374d9e65149cea78be864968c0a1dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_48c4d7b7c0ae11978b6f29fe58c3006802ee9651.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_bc3c20d9ff976a7c21896176b8a6a024b4314162.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_3e3316d3846e2c3b4ce352291200a457f9317471.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_2595ece9a7ab534866613e7716039e66bb3df6fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_b923ac3082d777893dfd5594f338b2c7dada5133.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_e12a1320cd1ab645c2e63a0e6ae196c8874b93bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_3d0d325e6f3f3378d04fb7f45fb2e0a0e9fbaa1e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_c3d9fbe72d9681dafb8903af50580dbaa75e9da7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/ss_cb687dc4b3c0dbcbf46a2465f0c211eca47262df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1644489785","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256696683/movie_max.mp4?t=1506534381,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256840410/movie_max.mp4?t=1632304405,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256840409/movie_max.mp4?t=1632304413"

You grew up with the roguelikes, witnessed the rise of the roguelites and even the birth of the roguelite-lites? We'd now like to present for your consideration our RogueVania , the illegitimate child of a modern Roguelite ( Rogue Legacy, Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Spelunky, etc.) and an old-school MetroidVania ( Castlevania: SotN and its ilk). Features: RogueVania : The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath. 2D Souls-lite Action : Tough but fair combat, more than fifty weapons and spells with unique gameplay, and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble. Nonlinear progression : Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style or just your mood. Exploration : Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air... Interconnected levels and progressive unlocking of access to the island provides you with a real incentive to explore your surroundings. Add in a degree of evolution for your character and permanent weapon upgrades and you can see where Dead Cells borrows from the long line of MetroidVanias that precede it. At the end of the day though, its YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly getting better, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Unforgiving combat wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenaline pumping ride each and every run and unrivaled replayability. Dead Cells left Early Access on August 7th 2018 and comes with: 13 Levels - Each one with its own atmosphere , foes and secrets to discover. 4 Bosses - Made by the most sadistic of the devs , raised on the salt of the testers. 90 or so weapons and skills - Spears, swords, bows, freeze blast, etc. 4 special powers, unlocking new areas and paths (metroidvania gear lock items). 1 epic responsive, fluid and fun to play combat system. 1 Daily Run Mode Complete with leaderboards for lording it over your mates.

244850,Space Engineers,"Feb 28, 2019",2000000,7179,0,19.99,11,"Space Engineers is an open world sandbox game defined by creativity and exploration. It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldnt be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.

232090,Killing Floor 2,"Nov 18, 2016",2000000,3137,17,29.99,3,"In KILLING FLOOR 2, players descend into continental Europe where the outbreak caused by Horzine Biotechs failed experiment has quickly spread and gained unstoppable momentum, essentially paralyzing the European Union Just one month after the events in the original KILLING FLOOR, the specimen clones are everywhere and civilization is in disarray; communications have failed, governments have collapsed, and military forces have been systematically eradicated. The people of Europe know survival and self-preservation too well and lucky survivors have gone into hiding. Not all have given up hope though... A group of civilians and mercenaries have banded together to combat the outbreak and established privately funded operation bases across Europe. Upon tracking specimen clone outbreaks, players will descend into zed-laden hot zones and exterminate them. KEY FEATURES:  Visceral Gore - KILLING FLOOR 2 ramps up the gore with a proprietary, high powered persistent blood system bringing new levels of fidelity to the genre. Players will send entrails, severed limbs, and blood flying as they wade through hordes of enemies. But they need to watch out! If caught, enemies will rip them, and their entire party limb from limb  6 player co-op or solo play A multitude of varied playable characters await for players to choose from as they enter the fray in online co-op mode or solo mode for those willing to brave the horrific specimens alone  Versus Survival Game Mode - Be the Zed! A 12 player PvP mode where two teams take turns playing Humans vs. Zeds in a pair of short matches. In the first match, one team plays Humans and the other Zeds until the humans all die during a single round or they beat the boss. For the second match the teams switch sides and when the battle is completed both teams receive a score based on their performance and the higher score wins!  Terrifying Zeds - New enemies and fan favorites from the original game are back with expanded and smarter artificial intelligence, dishing out powerful attacks, working as a group to weaken the players party and pushing the challenge level and fear factor to new levels  Unique Blend Of Weaponry - From modern militaristic assault rifles, brutal improvised makeshift weapons, classic historical guns, and off the wall Mad Scientist weapons, KILLING FLOOR 2 has a unique blend of killing tools that will satisfy any gamer  Expanded Perk System - Perks from the original game have been reimagined with more added to the fold. All perks now progress with meaningful talent choices that amplify different play styles, giving players a progression path that is expansive and full of rewarding milestones  Brutal Melee Combat - KILLING FLOOR 2 reinvents melee combat completely. Players now have control over the type of melee attacks they can perform, enabling them to deliver bone-breaking crippling attacks to Zeds  Zed Time - Be the action hero you know you are! Zed Time returns to Killing Floor 2 better than ever, kicking everything into slow motion giving you that precious time you need to destroy the oncoming horde while watching your weapons at work in

This classic grand strategy game gives you control of a nation through four dramatic centuries. Rule your land and dominate the world with unparalleled freedom, depth and historical accuracy. Write a new history of the world and build an empire for the ages. Start before the Renaissance on a map of the world as it was then. Choose from any of hundreds of nations and then rule up to the Age of Revolutions. Or, if you wish, start your game at any date in the span, with historical monarchs and other leaders. Hundreds of dynamic historical events are yours to experience, from merely troubling civil wars to world changing moments like the Protestant Reformation. Discover and settle the New World, or resist European conquest. Control the flow of trade by developing your trade power in key provinces, using ships and governmental policy to bring the wealth of the world to your own ports. Build alliances into iron bonds, cemented by royal marriage or play a flexible hand, keeping your options open. Strike when your enemies are weak, using your armies to grab new land and new potential riches. Your nations pace of development will be heavily influenced by the person on the throne. Experience rapid development under a skilled monarch only to see things slow down when a less competent heir takes over. Plan for the future by spending monarch power wisely. Four hundred years of research into new ways of war, administration and trade are available. Unlock new weapons, new buildings and new ship types.

While mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense Star Wars lightsaber battles as seen in the films.

KEY FEATURES Cinematic, Immersive Combat  Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat systemstriking, parrying, dodgingpartnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities youll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way.

Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time with a fantastic single-player action-adventure that marks the return of the playable Jedi. 9/10  IGN Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is the ideal example of a Star Wars game in 2019. Its an expert blend of multiple genres. It has characters that you love spending time with. It has the deeply attractive design aesthetic of the movies. But Fallen Order is more than just a good Star Wars game. Respawn has made one of the best 3D Metroidvania games ever. And its among the best Souls-like games as well. It is the kind of achievement that is only possible when one of the best developers in the world puts all of its might into making something special. And I hope we get more just like it in the future. 93/100  GamesBeat,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/header.jpg?t=1651767465,,https://help.ea.com/,,True,False,False,81,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,87943,9721,,39,81882,,945,2721,751,5165,Respawn Entertainment,Electronic Arts,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV","Action,Adventure","Action-Adventure,Souls-like,Third Person,Swordplay,Story Rich,Open World,Platformer,Exploration,Action,Sci-fi,RPG,Space,Fighting,Metroidvania,Puzzle,Fantasy,Adventure,Atmospheric,Hack and Slash,Family Friendly","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_695a5724e306269d81ca0118d86308a170c9e913.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_cfad9481db1a3b68fb5fcb2298cfc74bcb6a469e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_763dcc7434f072d6fdbb9037b4d37f4474e29d9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_045d78dba983384cf8282e617e7ba04e40a9e2e9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_effd33d4b798698bec179a5721dfba527e8432f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_8363c00f973874cc19a886e0370c6858a32e3793.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_dc2d50077b559b54f58b6dff572a4cf9479c54db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_fcdc1d9848bbc604fb38e1b740eee00e90b0a366.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_34f07a117f50f6c587a769b5bb496d7032424786.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_2dbe96ff08aed7bc02c82ba5256ce7d589cb34b7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_8ac0d74f6e4594f1ff141fb0f2defbd701755b81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_fad6cb499482042a9a2fe8f606f767c991424cdd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_0fcc7ad097befc7be78fbd2382be6649b3a7e7e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_bd9ea6ac0dc139132a05f80065364f3c8c1d71c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1172380/ss_b76c3e22424cff02441d13448f4d8dfda89c11bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651767465","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256765709/movie_max.mp4?t=1572357561,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256764626/movie_max.mp4?t=1572357570"

457140,Oxygen Not Included,"Jul 30, 2019",2000000,7507,0,24.99,2,"In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included youll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. Its Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency.

305620,The Long Dark,"Aug 1, 2017",2000000,1774,0,34.99,2,"Bright lights flare across the night sky. The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls 'the pinnacle of an entire genre'. The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - DO NOT GO GENTLE Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - LUMINACE FUGUE Mackenzies search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? EPISODE THREE - 'CROSSROADS ELEGY' In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? EPISODE FOUR - 'FURY, THEN SILENCE' A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION &amp; CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. SCOUR THE WORLD FOR SUPPLIES Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. A VAST LIVING WORLD Explore a 50 square kilometre Northern Canadian wilderness in search of precious supplies. In Winter. Dynamic time of day, weather, wildlife presence, etc. provide just enough randomness to keep things challenging. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Five Challenges exist at launch, with more on the way in future updates. In addition to releasing the remaining episode of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode, as we have done with about 100 updates/hotfixes over the past three years of Early Access. Keep in mind that your purchase of The Long Dark entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE, as well as the free updates we release to Survival Mode along the way..

In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges. It has been a long road. However, all stories must come to an end. This War of Mine has been giving you a thrilling experience of living through the war as a civilian for five years since its release. Numerous updates and expansions have broadened the experience and filled it with more shades and tonalities of hard civilian existence during wartime. Now, honoring the 5th anniversary of the original release, 11 bit studios proudly presents to you This War of Mine: Final Cut. This War of Mine: Final Cut contains all the updates and free expansions released so far and introduces not only a new scenario but also expands all scenarios with the locations known from Stories DLCs - even if you dont own those. In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges.

Go to Properties -&gt; Betas. From the drop-down list, choose vanilla - This War of Mine: Original Release 1.0 Close the window and update the game This War of Mine: Final Cut marks an end of an era for 11 bit studios, so lets hear what the art director Przemyslaw Marszal, the person who created the unique style of This War of Mine, has to say: We wanted to put the last touch to this phenomenon. The phenomenon, which made us who we are today as a team, equally in terms of creative fearlessness and business direction, and helped us pave our further way. Fantastic support from the gaming community was a huge part of that success, so it was without any doubt that this update must be free. We think of the Final Cut as a closing episode to the one-of-a-kind series This War of Mine has been. It will remain precious to our hearts and I dont know what ideas the future will bring but Final Cut is final by no means. The creative minds in our studio, who were with the game up to this point, started to pursue new challenges. So we're excited about what's coming. ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine - main features: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves  anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme The universe of This War of Mine has been expanded by following DLCs: The Little Ones - explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective - that of a child. This War of Mine: Anniversary Edition - this free DLC, created especially for the 2nd Anniversary of the game, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same  how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? This War of Mine: Stories DLCs: Episode 1: The Father's Promise  a heartbreaking tale of loss and hope in a war-torn city Episode 2: The Last Broadcast  where, as a radio operator, you are going to face moral dilemmas and decide, whether there is a price too high for the truth Episode 3: Fading Embers  portrays a story of Anja living in a warzone and carrying a heavy burden as she has to answer to herself what is more important - survival of human legacy or the survival of a man","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Italian', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Turkish', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","This War of Mine is a gripping survival sim, and a great study of survival during wartime and civil collapse. 8.4  IGN UK This War of Mine shows the horrors of war in a way, that we rarely can experience in a game. 9  Giga Games Is this a game you want to play? No. Is it a game anyone with a beating heart should play? Yes. A million times yes. It's a longform exercise in empathy, a sobering piece of work that fills in the blanks left when all we see of war are the headshots. It's a much-needed course correct in the current shoot-first-ask-questions-never gaming landscape that supposes war is won because one supreme badguy caught a bullet through his brainstem. No: It's won when the people who lived under his boot get to go home. 8  Gamespot",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/header.jpg?t=1656003833,http://www.thiswarofmine.com,http://forum.11bitstudios.com/,support@11bitstudios.com,True,True,True,83,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/this-war-of-mine?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,81265,6228,,55,73633,,793,184,311,281,11 bit studios,11 bit studios,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Indie,Simulation","Survival,War,Atmospheric,Singleplayer,Strategy,Simulation,Choices Matter,Crafting,Base-Building,Resource Management,Story Rich,Indie,Management,Post-apocalyptic,Emotional,Realistic,Drama,Psychological,2.5D,Stealth","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_9a8e8724d4bc5a1ffc25b5aa52ed0400a856db6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_2aebf3f26978369655c9d4316e627b084fa0a69e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_b65e44e1c5aa6ac2ea2d2b8f0eb94ff55c3cbd75.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_60caf1baf885322cd45c0f6a84a19b112316b04f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_35f5bbc7b4bcdf0f48c93d055705594ea4749336.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_69d59279fc6ac19a5c30a8209d753b1e8728fa40.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_d17fe787849891db9b1c7f5c0d1eb079affc6f0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_64243910e65df2963f953baa9d6056283205ea6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_03f1ffbb3b36999da7ab1305c4a2b6f54b057478.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_095feca4f334b0740d52bb3a58fca6d7c624265e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_28b7b1cd18ad4d4be25fef898a359445c0fcc9b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/ss_93b1ffea395ccc8d6f16dbd5d003efbb66f2f04e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656003833","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256864956/movie_max.mp4?t=1639476352,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256767262/movie_max.mp4?t=1573747449,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2032375/movie_max.mp4?t=1447361893"

Thrust into a raging civil war, you watch helplessly as invaders storm your village and slaughter your friends and family. Narrowly escaping the brutal attack, you grab your sword to fight back. Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces! Story: Bohemia  located in the heart of Europe, the region is rich in culture, silver, and sprawling castles. The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart. One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches. In the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre. Without a home, family, or future you end up in the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who is forming a resistance against the invasion. Fate drags you into this bloody conflict and shoves you into a raging civil war, where you help fight for the future of Bohemia. Features: Massive realistic open world: Majestic castles, vast fields, all rendered in stunning high-end graphics.

The action is unrelenting and every shot is deadly so each move must be quick and decisive if you hope to survive and unveil the sinister forces driving the bloodshed.

ABOUT THE GAME THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the rulers time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment  the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: theres no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small  like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction  but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but dont forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your societys population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands. PLAY ENDLESSLY Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and thats why there are 3 modes to play in Endless Mode. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions.

Underlords includes compelling singleplayer and multiplayer modes, and offers level progression with rewards. Play a strategic Standard game, a quick Knockout match, or co-op Duos match with a friend. SEASON ONE NOW AVAILABLE Season One comes with a City Crawl full of content, a Battle Pass full of rewards, and multiple ways to play online or offline. Dota Underlords is now out of Early Access and ready to play! CITY CRAWL Mama Eebs death has left a power vacuum in White Spire. Take back the city neighborhood by neighborhood, Underlord by Underlord, in the new City Crawl campaign. Complete puzzle challenges, win quick street-fights, and complete in-game challenges to clear paths and take over the city. Unlock rewards like new outfits for your Underlords, new wanted poster artwork, victory dances, and titles. BATTLEPASS Season One comes with a full Battle Pass offering over 100 rewards. Play matches, complete challenges, and unlock areas of the City Crawl to level up your Battle Pass and earn rewards. Rewards include new boards, weather effects, profile customization, skins, and other gameplay cosmetics. Many of these rewards can be earned for free simply by playing the game. For more rewards and content, players can purchase the Battle Pass for $4.99 on all platforms. The paid Battle Pass is not required to play the game, nor does it provide any gameplay specific advantage. WHITE SPIRE AWAITS A LEADER... A vertical metropolis of gambling and grit, just beyond the reach of Stonehall and Revtel; White Spire is known as a smugglers' paradise with loose morals and colorful residents to spare. Despite being overrun with syndicates, gangs, and secret societies, White Spire has never descended into chaos for one reason: Momma Eeb. She was respected... she was loved... and unfortunately, she was murdered last week. Eebs death has sent one question rippling through White Spires underworld: who is going to run the city? STRATEGIZE TO WIN: Recruit heroes and upgrade them into more powerful versions of themselves. MIX AND MATCH: Each hero you recruit can form unique alliances. Stacking your team with allied heroes will unlock powerful bonuses that can crush your rivals. UNDERLORDS: Choose from four Underlords to lead your crew to victory. Underlords are powerful units who fight on the field alongside your crew, and they each bring their own playstyle, perks, and abilities to the table. CROSSPLAY: Play on your platform of choice and battle players across the globe in a hassle-free crossplay experience. Running late? Start a match on your PC and finish it on your mobile device (and vice versa). Your profile in Dota Underlords is shared across all devices, so no matter what you play on, you're always making progress. RANKED MATCHMAKING: Everyone starts at the bottom, but by playing against other Underlords you'll climb through the ranks and prove you're worthy to rule White Spire. TOURNAMENT-READY: Create your own private lobbies and matches, then invite spectators to watch 8 Underlords duke it out. OFFLINE PLAY: Offering a sophisticated AI with 4 levels of difficulty, offline play is a great place to hone your skills. Pause and resume games at your leisure. SEASONAL ROTATION: Every season we'll say goodbye to certain Heroes, Items, and Alliances to make room for new additions that will shape the ever-evolving world of Underlords.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Bulgarian', 'Czech', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Finnish', 'Greek', 'Hungarian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Swedish', 'Thai', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Ukrainian', 'Vietnamese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1046930/header.jpg?t=1649700104,http://underlords.com/,https://help.steampowered.com,,True,True,True,0,,0,73491,15523,,0,0,,2706,151,326,278,Valve,Valve,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet","Casual,Free to Play,Strategy","Free to Play,Strategy,Casual,Auto Battler,Multiplayer,Tactical,Turn-Based Tactics,Chess,Turn-Based,Mature,Competitive,Fantasy,Board Game,Singleplayer,Deckbuilding,Card Game,Co-op,Automation,PvP,MOBA","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1046930/ss_25ad872bc9a8ecf634a76ce1d4bb22aea9b728c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1046930/ss_1bc613845672667a6e1f957e269543de629ace39.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1046930/ss_3eb9d9284194794e69d31b4d764b902d424f1af2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1046930/ss_cda4d2ee1a88f6640a8b1cac5c27647ad28a816f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1046930/ss_4c73e18e4b0242a25b8bd73576560deb7ff8124d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256881738/movie_max.mp4?t=1649700096

War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning . Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned or not. Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced. Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices. Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence. Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts. Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm. The paths to follow are limitless: experience thousands of dynamic events and life-altering decisions tailored to each and every conceivable situation and character. There are countless ways of securing and keeping your place in the history books.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean']","['English', 'Korean']",A new king of historical strategy has been crowned. 10/10  IGN Crusader Kings 3 is my Game of the Year so far. 5/5  VG 24/7 ...

Community  See other real players and empathize with their journey, learn from seeing how others died, find and leave messages for your fellow players; helping them or leading them into death. Symbolic of Life &amp; Hope  The Bonfire is an important feature in Dark Souls for many reasons.

Twenty years have passed since world leaders offered an unconditional surrender to alien forces. XCOM , the planets last line of defense, was left decimated and scattered. Now, in XCOM 2 , the aliens rule Earth, building shining cities that promise a brilliant future for humanity on the surface, while concealing a sinister agenda and eliminating all who dissent from their new order. Only those who live at the edges of the world have a margin of freedom. Here, a force gathers once again to stand up for humanity. Always on the run, and facing impossible odds, the remnant XCOM forces must find a way to ignite a global resistance, and eliminate the alien threat once and for all. XCOM ON THE RUN: Take command of the Avenger, an alien supply craft converted to XCOMs mobile headquarters. New open-ended gameplay lets you decide where to guide your strike team, how to grow popular support, and when to combat enemy counter-operations. RECRUIT RESISTANCE FIGHTERS: Five soldier classes, each with its own skill tree, let you create specific soldiers for your tactical plan. TACTICAL GUERRILLA COMBAT: New gameplay systems offer more tactical flexibility in combat. Use concealment to ambush enemy patrols. Loot enemies for precious gear and artifacts. Rescue VIPs and save fallen comrades by carrying them to the extraction point. A NEW BREED OF ENEMY: A diverse cast of enemies from powerful new alien species to the ADVENT, enforcers of the alien regime, offer a distinct tactical challenge. RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND UPGRADE: Configure and build rooms on the Avenger to give XCOM new capabilities on the battlefield. Use your Scientists and Engineers to research, develop and upgrade weapons and armor to fit your preferred tactics. EACH MISSION IS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE: Go on missions around the world, from wildlands to the heart of the alien-controlled megacities, to the depths of alien installations. There are virtually infinite combinations of maps, missions and goals.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Traditional Chinese']","Exceptionally tough, rewarding strategy and a masterful reworking of the XCOM formula.

205100,Dishonored,"Oct 8, 2012",2000000,612,17,9.99,5,"Dishonored is an immersive first-person action game that casts you as a supernatural assassin driven by revenge. With Dishonoreds flexible combat system, creatively eliminate your targets as you combine the supernatural abilities, weapons and unusual gadgets at your disposal. Pursue your enemies under the cover of darkness or ruthlessly attack them head on with weapons drawn. The outcome of each mission plays out based on the choices you make. Story: Dishonored is set in Dunwall, an industrial whaling city where strange steampunk- inspired technology and otherworldly forces coexist in the shadows. You are the once-trusted bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed for her murder, you become an infamous assassin, known only by the disturbing mask that has become your calling card. In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man  but at what cost? The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once had is gone forever. Key features: Improvise and Innovate Approach each assassination with your own style of play. Use shadow and sound to your advantage to make your way silently through levels unseen by foes, or attack enemies head-on as they respond to your aggression. The flexible combat system allows you to creatively combine your abilities, supernatural powers and gadgets as you make your way through the levels and dispatch your targets. Improvise and innovate to define your play style. Action with Meaning The world of Dishonored reacts to how you play. Move like a ghost and resist corruption, or show no mercy and leave a path of destruction in your wake. Decide your approach for each mission, and the outcomes will change as a result. Supernatural Abilities Teleport for stealth approaches, possess any living creature, or stop time itself to orchestrate unearthly executions! Combining your suite of supernatural abilities and weapons opens up even more ways to overcome obstacles and eliminate targets. The games upgrade system allows for the mastery of deadly new abilities and devious gadgets. A City Unlike Any Other Enter an original world envisioned by Half-Life 2 art director Viktor Antonov.

You wake up in unknown surroundings to the sound of the Game Masters unfamiliar voice. Surrounded by five others, a third of your group have been infected with the Game Masters deadly virus and tasked with taking down the other innocent players. Innocents must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected try to pick you off one by one. When playing as an innocent, youll progress through the map and come across items to help you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more information on your teammates and what side theyre likely to be on. A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work together to gather weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting blood and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. At the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players to transform into their terror form and attack. Youll need this form to kill innocent players. In terror form youre faster, stronger, and have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense killing animations youll be able to create some frightening but also amusing gameplay! Deceit combines the frenzy of fast paced combat mixed with strategic gameplay, and of course the psychological mind games of determining who you can trust.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain', 'German', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'French', 'Italian', 'Hungarian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Dutch', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Turkish', 'Romanian']","['English', 'Romanian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/header.jpg?t=1657121023,http://www.playdeceit.com/,https://discord.gg/deceit,,True,False,False,0,,0,65235,17395,,14,2521,Includes moderate violence and blood.,449,123,94,187,World Makers,World Makers,"Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,In-App Purchases,Partial Controller Support,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet","Action,Free to Play,Indie","PvP,Free to Play,Multiplayer,Horror,Social Deduction,FPS,Shooter,Strategy,First-Person,Funny,Choices Matter,Psychological Horror,Action,Zombies,Atmospheric,Psychological,Mystery,Survival,Survival Horror,Co-op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_ea457e5df9154c949526c1ae976987ccd13f3502.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_37521c7b93bbe3b19543292da132f55e7cb7a9f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_706bc026d19d22994dc3ed57f5330ce794a5ba40.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_01fa8066ad0497c37e5fb1d1f1f967f19f8cf04c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_eba8ddd5fb786423dd244acc35957081c1f18228.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_fce71a2616f5faded35d201df570cd33a44daf61.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_30f414e72482a1138a619105dbe743a007ea30ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_cce8b062473a8e4997aa1cf76b2dbeecf2f2dfb6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_39d2f96ac3b7e55501e3a5be765c14dd41700c91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_921941660cba8daabf93360a1aa0d5c4cdd5ef16.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_2d46d322a9b0f97d4b6c6ba7b2e7aa18503b748e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_89b3d8a7e32d2a460a0a7fcde66df069b9a392b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_e583711d95155a2f3734c27a6e5931f06324cd33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_4bac8498b722b82026a7a2284be4e87ca6d22318.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_eda6b31e14c17e63c766b955d179eb8fd3b9bc06.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_3333654d3b0d51c67007b7275aa4633da03b4334.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_0dfa1977aaed64863a64c895475cd0a2af24817e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_fcd43a8c1ea64c03fae19c3beb995e35f4e14727.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_e40960dfe7fc05fad66e5b6861e03438119ae8a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_fbd88f7d11fcd0474b8980314f116f777ecee211.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/ss_c17ee38974f4d0ae8a513a006468fde707a85481.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657121023","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256881213/movie_max.mp4?t=1649353596,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256895069/movie_max.mp4?t=1657121016,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689027/movie_max.mp4?t=1498836797,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256733184/movie_max.mp4?t=1540394201"

55230,Saints Row: The Third,"Nov 14, 2011",2000000,532,17,9.99,20,"Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobble head dolls all available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute. Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and defend yourself against a highly-trained military force using only a sex toy in the most out- landish gameplay scenarios ever seen, igniting a city-wide war that will set Steelport on fire. Strap it on.","['Czech', 'Dutch', 'English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/header.jpg?t=1623408556,http://www.saintsrow.com/,helpcenter.deepsilver.com,,True,False,True,84,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/saints-row-the-third?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,62666,2675,,83,45398,,1460,351,857,351,Volition,Deep Silver,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet",Action,"Open World,Action,Comedy,Co-op,Third-Person Shooter,Funny,Sandbox,Character Customization,Third Person,Online Co-Op,Singleplayer,Great Soundtrack,Shooter,Multiplayer,Crime,Female Protagonist,Adventure,Satire,Zombies,RPG","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_e861c75bec732e56378e13209a8a402476891c67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_718766019fb13440e16fc8801ef8a76a0d4c690a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_3b69a3456e60b01debe1968cf26d1b7681b69d52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_32ff71cd7d725f29c224d0554456b26fc532c4da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_744ad5d262b950ac37084d48fdbd48ca72302dcc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_c750d085934a63a4cbc88aeca3cf7a03dc27c3fb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_d0c4db38537c48c2273a58e20b2c72148fbd05d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_f46436d0230eedaf9512b178f52be5d44b791143.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_53b38a56faf2ff6d2ca38cb16a52eec1ec5ceb83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_a3b0bc7cb906da1ae40c3869b0048eacf0b54411.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_f16ddb3751130e0a966ee0c740f3fdae1244a10c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_fc7d27cb8606783dedadfb64ba2ed0a7522ad454.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_4adedeba4d4dfe843a8c60f5fb7124e5299ea52a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/55230/ss_283fe59efe783826915bd93847a1abe4efd1a0b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623408556",

1366540,Dyson Sphere Program,"Jan 20, 2021",2000000,5269,0,19.99,2,"Dyson Sphere Program is a sci-fi simulation game with space, adventure, exploration and factory automation elements where you can build your own galactic industrial empire from scratch. In the distant future, the power of science and technology has ushered a new age to the human race. Space and time have become irrelevant thanks to virtual reality. A new kind of supercomputer has been developed  a machine whose superior artificial intelligence and computing capability will push humanity even further. There is only one problem: there isnt enough energy in the whole planet to feed this machine. You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that humanity needs. Only a few decades ago, Dyson Spheres were considered a hypothetical, impossible invention  but now its in your hands Will you be able to turn a backwater space workshop into a galaxy-wide industrial production empire? Neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, gaseous and rocky planets There is a big and varied universe out there, waiting for you to gather all its resources. Every playthrough will be unique: your universe will be procedurally generated every time you start a new game. There will be different types and distribution of stars, planets and resources. Will you manage to thrive and build your Spheres, no matter what the universe throws at you? As a space engineer, you are expected to design your interstellar factory and production lines, not to micromanage every small package going back and forth. You have to transport materials from one planet to another, forming interstellar transport teams that gather resources and bring them to where they are needed. Then, your resources can be transported between facilities through conveyor belts, and youve got the technology to help your buildings fit the grid automatically during the construction process. Youve got the best tools COSMO can afford to build a massive-scale automated production line  the most efficient one ever seen in the universe! Build a galactic industrial empire from scratch: start with a small workshop and improve it until it spans the whole galaxy Develop your very own Dyson Spheres , a megastructure that orbits around a star harnessing all its power and energy, from the first screw to its completion Explore a vast universe procedurally generated with all kinds of celestial bodies: neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants Gather resources in planets of all types: ocean, lava, desert, frozen, gaseous planets Research new technologies to improve your factories and discover the secrets of the universe Enhance mecha fly, sail or jump through outer space and planets Transport materials across the galaxy to your facilities: thousands of transport ships will flow endlessly to your factories and back! Design the most efficient automated factory and production line Customize your factory and Dyson Sphere to make it unique Design a balanced power network capable of producing energy in all kinds of power plants like wind turbines, artificial stars, etc . We are a five-person team from Chongqing, China. For the love of sci-fi, we've created this game Dyson Sphere Program. Perhaps Dyson Sphere has already appeared in many games, but this time we hope that players can build it step by step with your own hands.","['Simplified Chinese', 'English']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/header.jpg?t=1656474588,,http://www.gameragame.com/,support@gameragame.com,True,False,False,0,,0,62266,1425,,100,57528,,3500,3438,1244,5531,Youthcat Studio,Gamera Games,"Single-player,Remote Play on Tablet","Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Space,Base-Building,Automation,Building,Open World,Simulation,Resource Management,Sci-fi,Management,Sandbox,City Builder,Strategy,Singleplayer,Space Sim,3D,Third Person,Early Access,Indie,RTS,Casual","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_ca1c8ba11e539cbeb8f4d91f6685b0fa01ddf705.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_36242c2930a50355982a0da128f37e23e25a1047.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_602b6ca003277c4a70f63bd723a494a5558e1aee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_7b635ae1ca6d88b52fca183407f06cfd94850b26.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_b5fdcae44ab61e86820d156a74bd030b4782b8a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_475933730894ab89e3a8b961f8fc18399ee2a1df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_995e50fbac3e936624d0bd4d1493140f77f78d11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_9607434535c149b37a4d19facd946adfa8ca02f1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_1b22058e7b58db0f2d9770757974af6a7fb719c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_9e06789bd41f956531e946597c81d57fce862ad4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_da7276928ed645446501c3465ec0aaeb24998826.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_74fd2f87cc4632c6a6653d40d143d5d6f26dedd3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_5a7b3dac5064a6ac09ddef5d9554987b47fa4fbe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_d842f20366d266b2efe4c3493de68bb1fc12ffcb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_1f699b2ba7ce5025064050cf5498f6a576b89d31.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366540/ss_23c17fdd4a2ab51f48d7c2a64cdde92104dbac99.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656474588","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256893051/movie_max.mp4?t=1655893831,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256817724/movie_max.mp4?t=1610263789,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256800538/movie_max.mp4?t=1600949954"

Due to the severity of the operation, the new life becomes the last thing the patients remember before drawing their last breath. Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didnt. This particular story follows their attempt to fulfill the dream of an elderly man, Johnny. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny's past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is. And Johnny's last wish is, of course... to go to the moon.

224260,No More Room in Hell,"Oct 31, 2013",5000000,672,0,0.0,1,"'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' A tribute to the highly acclaimed film series in which the above quote originated from, No More Room in Hell (PC Gamer's Mod of the Year 2011, ModDB's Editor Choice Multiplayer Mod of the Year 2011), is a co-operative realistic first person survival horror modification for the Source Engine. Taking inspiration from George Romero's 'Of the Dead' series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill. The chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation. Features: Teamwork: Co-operative play with up to eight players. Voice and Text Communications Limited by Distance: The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close! Dynamic Objective Maps: The next playthrough may not be the same as the last! Survival Mode: Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area. A Realistic Approach: In short, no crosshairs with limited 'only when you want it' HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head! Multitude of Different Opponents: Ranging from the iconic 'walking zombie' to the more contemporary 'runners', NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead... Infection: One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure... 30+ weapons and counting, ranging from the diminutive .22 Target Pistol, to the almighty Chainsaw. No ads (on official and community official servers, user-hosted servers may vary) No pay to win items or microtransactions 100% Free (unless you buy the soundtrack DLC &lt;3) No More Room in Hell is a Half-Life 2 Zombification. The mod was founded in 2003. It switched hands and a new team took over in 2009. Beta version 1.0 was released on Halloween of 2011. A full list of the No More Room in Hell Team and contributors can be found on the about page of our website: www.nmrih.com .","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Japanese', 'Greek', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Hungarian', 'Russian', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Ukrainian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean', 'Czech', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Turkish']","['English', 'Turkish']",'NMRiH is a stand-out take on survival and the scariest multiplayer game we've ever played.'

Players must solve physical puzzles and challenges by opening portals to maneuvering objects, and themselves, through space.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Russian', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Finnish', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Swedish', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/header.jpg?t=1608593358,http://www.whatistheorangebox.com/,http://steamcommunity.com/app/400,,True,True,True,90,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/portal?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,56620,1154,,15,91622,,0,0,0,0,Valve,Valve,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Captions available,Partial Controller Support,Includes level editor,Includes Source SDK,Commentary available,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play Together",Action,"Puzzle,First-Person,Singleplayer,Sci-fi,Comedy,Female Protagonist,Funny,Physics,Action,Story Rich,Platformer,Classic,Science,FPS,Atmospheric,Short,Masterpiece,Adventure,Dark Humor,Great Soundtrack","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/0000002582.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/0000002583.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/0000002584.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/0000002585.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/0000002586.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/0000002587.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/0000002588.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/ss_25aa95176ac6319fad955b31554451f3ea61f1e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/ss_15c08be59046abbd785ab8e7e8857ba8633f292b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/ss_5d9a2b799aaaa6f8992128c126e68b7e8d718715.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/400/ss_3164c436ce7708dcf0f46bb4569e7f7b83ccb01e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1608593358",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/922/movie_max.mp4?t=1608593347

Please remember that the Beta build is still an incomplete version of the game. It will still have bugs and quirks, and will require lots of additional content before it is ready for full release. Because of our Supporters and with your help, we will continue to push Ready or Not, adding more content (new maps, missions, characters, weapons, etc.), and further refining it to get the game up to the standard that you deserve. We ultimately want you to be able to turn the lights out, crank up the volume, and be immersed in the action  bringing order to chaos. Realism First VOID interactive has consulted with police teams globally to create rules of engagement and a scoring system that are both challenging and realistic. In order to push the bar further with realism, Ready or Not models ballistic penetration, ricochet, kevlar and plate dynamics, as well as projectile expansion and momentum. Robust and natural controls Explore a deep and involved weapon handling and player maneuvering system, geared towards providing officers with an unprecedented level of control over their situational effectiveness. Ready or Not utilizes a simple and organic control scheme which wont have players fumbling around, forgetting dozens of key bindings. Planning Organize an approach, then execute the mission in real time. Officers can decide to deploy with items such as ballistic shields, door rams, tactical ladders, and much more. Command your team Team leaders will command a smartly designed team of AI officers in single player. Diverse modes Bring order to chaos online with friends through a tactical cooperative experience, lead a crack team of AI-driven swat members in a solo, story-rich campaign, or battle a rogue organization in a fierce and competitive multiplayer environment. Intelligent customization With access to over 60 unique items, players are given the tools to tackle any situation. The right combination of weapon optics, muzzle modifications, magazine types and foregrip variations gives an officer the edge in combat. Alternatively, load up with plates and heavy armor to prevent a quick end, at the expense of agility. Officers can also personalize their unit with team-specific patches and uniforms.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Czech', 'Korean', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144200/header.jpg?t=1656646890,https://voidinteractive.net,https://voidinteractive.net/,support@voidinteractive.net,True,False,False,0,,0,55714,4487,,1,50623,"Given the graphic nature of the game and the gritty realism it portrays, the game is for mature audiences.

513710,SCUM,"Aug 29, 2018",2000000,10223,0,34.99,3,"The worlds unquenchable need for entertainment has turned towards bloodlust as entertainment behemoth TEC1 is set to premiere season two of its television sensation SCUM. This new season moves the contest from the rugged, enclosed indoor arenas to the lush forests, rolling fields, and rugged terrains of TEC1s own private SCUM Island. Both fan favorites and new prisoners will clash in a ruthless war of survival while battling for the support of viewers, producers, and corporate sponsors for fame, gifts, and a chance of life after death. SCUM aims to evolve the multiplayer open world survival game with unprecedented levels of character customization, control and progression, where knowledge and skills are the ultimate weapons for long-term survival. Combining the methodical planning and management of hardcore survival with optional PvP network events available to everyone at anytime, SCUM strikes a unique balance between complex simulation and intense action in the next generation of survival game. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev updates on scumgame.com and on Twitter @SCUMgame. FEATURES [ALPHA] Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems to allow players to go as deep as they choose into the management of their character. Players can delve into the minutia of the survival experience through systems controlling their characters metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details... Massive Landscape: Traverse and explore 225 sq km of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns, and rundown airfields. Each location telling it's own story and filled with wildlife and dangers.The massive terrain can be traversed by foot, land vehicles, boats or aircraft. PvP Network Events: Enter TEC1s ongoing network events with a click of a button and be whisked to enclosed areas of the island for white-knuckle PvP gameplay. Volunteer for an event and be pitted against other prisoners with fame points and high value loot on the line for those that survive. Expanding Gameplay: While the current version of SCUM already includes basic crafting, combat, and customization systems, the featureset and gameplay will continually expand to include more advanced mechanics, more variety in gameplay, and a metanarrative for players to complete missions with hopes of one day getting off the island... Online Multiplayer: Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server right from the in-game menu.

And it does this all while maintaining an air of realism. Rock Paper Shotgun The developers say that theyve created the most realistic simulation of the human metabolic system ever made, the end result of which is a fairly regular requirement that my avatar urinate and empty his bowels. Polygon Owners of the Scum Supporters Pack will get an additional two inches on their unit, which they can swing around as a badge of honor or sacrifice for bonus points elsewhere. Not even kidding.

With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference. THREE WARRING EMPIRES Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more. MASSIVE WARFARE Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory. ENORMOUS MAPS PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings. PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS In PlanetSide 2 the war isnt won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle. CLASS-BASED COMBAT Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more. Heavy Assault: Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis. Light Assault: Go where the Heavies cant with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes! Combat Medic: Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. Infiltrator: Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. Engineer: Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. MAX: Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death. OUTFIT TEAMWORK Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization. VEHICLES &amp; WEAPONS Train and equip your soldier how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.

Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. Features Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No 'hero' characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a 'game', you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A characters stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Japanese', 'German', 'Russian', 'French', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean']","['English', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Japanese', 'German', 'Russian', 'French', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean']","'Kenshi impresses the bejeesus out of me.

438740,Friday the 13th: The Game,"May 25, 2017",2000000,460,17,14.99,6,"Gameplay Friday the 13th: The Game is a third-person horror, survival game where players take on the role of a teen counselor, or for the first time ever, Jason Voorhees. You and six other unlucky souls will do everything possible to escape and survive while the most well-known killer in the world tracks you down and brutally slaughters you. Friday the 13th: The Game will strive to give every single player the tools to survive, escape or even try to take down the man who cannot be killed. Each and every gameplay session will give you an entirely new chance to prove if you have what it takes not only to survive, but to best the most prolific killer in cinema history, a slasher with more kills than any of his rivals! Meanwhile, Jason will be given an array of abilities to track, hunt and kill his prey. Stalk from the shadows, scare your targets and kill them when the time is right in as brutal a fashion as you can imagine. Take control of the legendary killer that is Jason Voorhees and terrify those unfortunate enough to cross your path! Play as Jason Voorhees! For the first time ever, you will have the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees, the most famous killer in horror. Stalk your prey, ambush them whenever you see fit and strike fear in the hearts of so many hapless victims as you become the legend himself! Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. Youll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies! Jason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes! Fans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including: Friday the 13th, Part II Friday the 13th, Part III Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives Friday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday How Will You Survive? The entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence. Friday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike! Play as the Counselors! We all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor! Camp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory! Mirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey. Players will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods! Your Crystal Lake Database Friday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account. The longer you play, the more you'll unlock from counselor customization to new Jason Voorhees costumes seen in the movies! Besides giving you personalized camp counselors, you'll be able to unlock secrets within Camp Crystal Lake, exploring the mystery surrounding Jason Voorhees and the grounds he patrols! Be Kind. Rewind. Every aspect of Friday the 13th: The Game is drawn straight from movies you know and love. Weve carefully crafted this world to remind you of everything you remember about Friday the 13th, right down to the visual fidelity of the 80s. This is exactly how you remember it.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/header.jpg?t=1591725284,http://www.f13game.com,www.jasonkillsbugs.com,f13game@fearthegun.com,True,False,False,61,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,53814,14370,,53,57363,,1646,399,196,592,IllFonic,Gun Media,"Multi-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on TV",Action,"Horror,Multiplayer,Survival Horror,Survival,Gore,Violent,Co-op,Third Person,Action,Stealth,Psychological Horror,Dark,Mature,Atmospheric,Open World,Funny,Adventure,Singleplayer,Difficult,Nudity","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_99ef88f20f0b3181b75d994351f66bd7fe42830e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_f38c8ff2d0dd95279ac412dcd99a4c72dd180445.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_3ee855d44283802cc3c9e1542f501b3626995f29.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_a1daf123db0fb6e0b9f0a78750f4f1eab9845e9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_c4edf37b5b56ed89add71dab96dea54020b75391.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_b9dd291cfed5d993743862f0a4b0b5bff1c033e9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_a28151613eb9ce6f1f16482240e5e993b3b53145.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_960f1aace578562f02a277a5320165806421cdb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_53069020d636b477636ba617e46519370fd93b7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/438740/ss_a6c993ebb04e1dbaba9a4f789cc3b86ae1f44c67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591725284","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256683364/movie_max.mp4?t=1492525158,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677408/movie_max.mp4?t=1483468624,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677409/movie_max.mp4?t=1483468633,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677410/movie_max.mp4?t=1483468645"

265930,Goat Simulator,"Apr 1, 2014",2000000,123,0,9.99,5,"Goat Simulator is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU. You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! WASD to write history. Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! Or you could just give Steam Workshop a spin and create your own goats, levels, missions, and more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. Disclaimer Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat. Key Features You can be a goat Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat Steam Workshop support - make your own goats, levels, missions, game modes, and more! MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it In-game physics that bug out all the time Seriously look at that goat's neck You can be a goat Mac and Linux Disclaimer The Mac and Linux ports are still in Beta.
